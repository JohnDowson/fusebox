# fusebox [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/fusebox.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/fusebox) [![CI status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/JohnDowson/fusebox/rust.yml)](https://github.com/JohnDowson/fusebox/actions)
Mostly safe and sound append-only collection of trait objects.

## Why?
This avoids extra indirection of `Vec<dyn Trait>`, which might matter for you.
I personally use it in [pcmg](https://github.com/JohnDowson/pcmg) audio synthesizer for fusing together multiple filters and oscillators.
